The **Free City Arena** is a large coliseum and center for civic activity in the [Clerkburg]() district of the Free City , hosting events including gladiatorial combat, holiday celebrations, and sporting events.

The Arena is and large oval, bowl-shaped stadium. It holds eighteen to twenty thousand attendees.

The expensive seats are centered along the northern long side of the oval of the Arena, beside the Director's box. The Director's Palace is just outside the Arena adjacent to the north wall (and connected by secret, private tunnel)

## History

There was a horrid attempt at mass murder, involving releasing a gargantuan worm-like monster created by [[Kyuss]] (an ulgurstasta) in the Arena. Though it was stopped, the conspirators planned on sacrificing the thousands of spectators in the audience to Kyuss. The then-Arena Director,[[ Loris Raknian]], was involved in the plot. 



# The Champion's Games

This annual event, organized and produced by well-known and well-liked public figure [[Loris Raknian]], has long been a much-beloved tradition in The Free City. Gladiators come from distant lands to participate in the games, and the winner gains the honour of wearing the Champion’s Belt for the next year, when he must defend his title from all challengers.

We fought for the Champions Belt here and were victorious!
