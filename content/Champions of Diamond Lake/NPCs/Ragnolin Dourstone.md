# Ragnolin Dourstone

About 50 years ago. Ragnolin Dourstone left his clan home in the halls of the dwarven stronghold of Greysmere. His greed and lust for power drove him to establish several mining operations in the area, with the most lucrative centered in Diamond Lake. Unlike the other mine managers, he is not opposed to [[Balabar Smenk]]. His mines are profitable and diversified enough that he isn't worried about Smenk's treachery, and Dourstone knows he will outlive the human.
